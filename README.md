## Capstone-SQL
project on SQL
###### overview:
The AirlineDB is a database used as the basis for tutorials to teach SQL. The database contains the flights data related to transactions, tickets, flights, airports and flight schedules.
###### Task: 

The task is to write SQL queries based on the scenario asked using the AirlineDB

###### Question
• How many tickets are there without boarding passes? 

• Represent the "book date" column in "yyyy-mm-dd" format using Bookings table

• Identify the most popular product in each store based on quantity sold

• The management team is interested in a detailed comparison of sales performance across all stores on a quarterly basis. Your objective is to calculate the total sales for each store for each quarter and then rank the stores based on these sales figures. This analysis will help identify top-performing stores and those that may require strategic adjustments

• Rank airports based on the number of flights departing from them

###### Action: 
•	Written SQL queries based on the scenario asked to get the desired results.

•	Written the SQL queries using joints, Common Table Expression (CTE),aggregation function,sub clause and windows function.

•	We used the ER diagram to find the connection between the table to write the correct query to get the desired results
